# helloworld
This is where I'll be putting some longstanding personal projects. I still have to make a logic branch.

Right now, I just have 2 branches.
1. The template -- a makefile, and "modules" setup, because I find it a little nicer to work with than usual C practices
2. My very messy vulkan implementation, and whatever I happen to be doing with it. It's fast and loose, incomplete, but it's a continuous personal study that I'm happy to share.
